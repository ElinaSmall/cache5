07.05.2023 Cryo-EM_structures of complexes MCHR1+MCH and MCHR2+MCH were published in the article:
Mechanisms of ligand recognition and activation of melanin-concentrating hormone receptors (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-024-00679-8#data-availability). 


RMSD Ca-atoms between Cryo-EM-Structure of MCHR1+MCH (complex) and Alfa Fold 3 generated complex MCHR1+MCH without templates: 1.704 A.
(This example illustrates that Alfa Fold 3 alone can't be used without template based models for cyclic peptide modeling). Nevertheless, the relative position of the R residue in MCHR1 helped to recognize D3.32 as a potentially critical residue.
